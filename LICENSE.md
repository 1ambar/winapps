This project is licensed under a dual license.

The original project by Fmstrat <https://github.com/Fmstrat/winapps/> is not free software.
Due to lack of a license, it is All Rights Reserved by the original author.

We have tried contacting Fmstrat about this, but they abandoned the project and did not reply nor apply an open-source license to the project.
However, almost all parts of the codebase have been rewritten and all new contributions require a Contributor License Agreement ([for individuals](https://gist.github.com/oskardotglobal/35f0a72eb45fcc7087e535561383dbc5), [for legal entities](https://gist.github.com/oskardotglobal/75a8cc056e56a439fa6a1551129ae47f)) to be signed.
Therefore, the below license is applied to all new contributions made to the project, releasing it into the public domain.

Refer to a specific file for it's respective license.
